To compile the examples you must have the Nvidia HPC SDK installed.
Then, go to one of the gpuExamples, and change to the build/ directory.
There, do:

cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=nvc++

If this command finishes successfully, you are all set for:

make -j

The specific example should compile, and the executable
should be located at the parent directory of build/.
